                    <p>Our unique Salon Concept was specifically designed for established Barber, Beauty and Health & Wellness professionals who have an existing clientele. 
                We do our best to create a Win-Win situation that is good for both parties for many years to come. And based on our experience, 
                in most cases we do recommend that a potential candidate be established in one of our markets for at least two years.

                    <p>Although many of our current suite holders originally came to us with a desire to grow their client counts (and ultimately their profits), 
                our goal is to help ensure that potential suite holders start and stay successful at Salon Suites for as long as they are able and 
                willing to offer their services in that market. 
                
                If you are unsure, we encourage you to contact us and schedule a confidential "Success Consultation" where we can consult you on the 
                business and financial aspects of salon suites ownership to help you determine if the timing is right for you!
